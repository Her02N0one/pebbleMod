# Pebble Mod (Canceled)

* Discord Server: https://discord.gg/YBhCY5Q
* Curseforge Page + Download: not up yet (still developing)
* Tumblr Development Blog: (maybe later)


This was fun as my first time colaborating on a code base, definitly not going anywhere with this anymore lol,
this was mostly just a test to see what I could make

Pebble mod is a mod that add pebbles and fossils to mincecraft

We hope to implement:
* Fossils that spawn naturally
* ~sprite cranberry~
* cool weapons
* and other stuff I guess
